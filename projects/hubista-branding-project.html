                                    For this project, we began with extensive research, including question and answer meetings with the client to determine their goals for the project. In addition to gathering valuable information about their mission and strategy, this approach allowed us to identify the product's key areas of refinement in advance of creating the Brand Identity.

                                    We wanted our client to feel involved during this part, and the goal for us was to learn as much as possible about Hubistas core. The business, their world, and the opportunities of the brand.                        
                                </p>

                                    We used a combination of desk research and insights from conversations with people in the target group to narrow down categories of services they wanted to focus on, refining their value proposition, and giving them tasks to further define parts of their business plan.                       
                                    We ended this part of the process by creating a Creative Brief. This approach intended was to first fully align on what Hubista is and should be, and then build the brand on top of this foundation - always having something to refer to and back up future design decisions.

                                            The Creative Brief included Background, Audit, Job Story, Opportunity, and Challenges.

                                    We narrowed Hubista’s target audience by converting all of the personas into two main groups, Sellers and Buyers. From there, we wrote two job stories for each group.
                                    This allowed us to do fewer assumptions and more focus on the drivers and the motivation behind our target group.

                                        After reviewing our findings in the initial phase, our team understood that to be able to move forward, we needed to position Hubista in the market. Deciding on how wide, or narrow they wanted to go was a crucial step before starting working on our deliverables. We solved this together with the client by giving them three different options, called Creative Directions.                                         <p>

                                    Each proposed Direction contained a draft of a Brand Narrative, a Brand Principle, Pros / Cons, and a summary on 'How to make it work'. This was valuable for both our team to get an overview of the potential in the different approaches, but also for our client to understand that design for everyone is to design for no one.

                                    We tried to make our client feel as involved as possible. We now had agreed on a set of deliverables, and by starting to and asking Associative questions like "How does Hubista sound?", using their answers in our creative process.

                                        Our challenge now was to create a concept that is straightforward when usability is key, but that also acts as a stage for personal stories and expression when inspiration is needed the most. A system that is both Inspirational as well as a Trustworthy.
                                        We solved this challenge by creating two modes; From simple to expressive. This allowed us to dial our designs up and down, still being true to our Creative Direction.

                                    The last step before designing was to agree on a list of all the core elements of the Hubista. This would serve as a 'design toolbox' that includes all the brand elements necessary for a comprehensive design process.

                                    The unification of the strategy, concept, and design that emphasizes the client’s key messages were at the core of this project. It all resulted in a compiled Brand Book for our client - a guide on all aspects of the design, and how the different parts worked together into the final identity.
